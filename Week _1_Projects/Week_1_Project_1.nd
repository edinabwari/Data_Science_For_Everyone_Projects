**Week One project: Churn Prediction for Sprint **
Question
Imagine you're working with Sprint. They're really keen on figuring out how many customers might decide 
to leave them in the coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have 
left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that.
 So, if you were in charge of predicting customer churn how would you go about using machine learning to make
 a good guess about which customers might leave? Like, what steps would you take to create a machine learning 
 model that can predict if someone's going to leave or not?

Answer

There are various processes involved in building a machine learning model to forecast client churn. Here is a general outline of how I could go about doing this work.

1.	Collect and prepare the data available.
•	I will prepare the bunch of past data and gather information available about the consumers by using a variety of historical data about when previous customers left as well as information about who these customers are, their demographics, purchase history, usage patterns, customer service interactions, what they've purchased, and other similar information.
•	Clean up and preprocess the data, this will involve dealing with difficulties in data formatting, outliers, and missing numbers. The available data will need to be cleansed and preprocessed so that the model can make use of it.
2.	EDA, (exploratory data analysis).
•	This is the crucial process of doing first analyses on data in order to find patterns, uncover anomalies, test hypotheses, and double-check assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations. I will explore the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between different features and churn. I’ll need to analyze trends in the data to find the main reasons behind customer churn. And visualize the data to identify patterns and correlations.
3.	Feature Engineering:
•	Here, I will focus on choosing, modifying, and converting raw data into features that may be applied in supervised learning. This step will help me build and train better features in order to make the model learn effectively on new tasks. In simple terms, in this step I will focus on transforming unprocessed observations into desired features using statistical or machine learning techniques to create relevant features that can help the model make better predictions. 

4.	Data Splitting:
•	I will proceed by splitting the dataset into three categories. This includes training, validation, and test sets. The training set I will use to train the model, the validation set I will use to tune hyperparameters, and the test set I will use to evaluate the model's performance.
5.	Model Selection: 
•	A suitable machine learning algorithm will then be selected for the model. Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks are a few of the often-used options. I'll also test out many algorithms to see which one works best for my particular dataset before carefully choosing the top algorithm.
6.	Model Training:
•	Here, I will train the model on the training data using the chosen algorithm. Once I have the chosen algorithm, I would need to train the model on the prepared data. This involves feeding the algorithm the data and allowing it to learn the relationships between the different variables. Tune hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation to optimize model performance.
7.	Model Evaluation:
•	After training the model, I will proceed to evaluate the model's performance on the validation and test sets using relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. This would provide an idea of the model's potential performance on fresh data. In order to make sure the model makes accurate predictions; I will compare its performance to that of a baseline model (such as a random guess).
8.	Deployment:
•	Once the model is trained and validated and I feel satisfied that the model is able to predict customers behavior and churn, I will go on to deploy it into the production environment, where it can be used to make real-time predictions on new customer data.
9.	Monitoring and Maintenance:
•	Once 	I have deployed the model in the production environment, I will continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it periodically with new data to ensure its accuracy remains high. This will involve checking for issues, modifications as needed, and prospective issues. The purpose of maintenance and monitoring is to guarantee the ongoing use, dependability, and security of the model, by performing software updates, hardware maintenance, configuring management.
10.	Feedback Loop:
•	A feedback loop is an ongoing, iterative process for fine-tuning and enhancing the model based on user feedback and assessments of its effectiveness. The model will rely on the feedback loop process since it will enable me to continuously enhance and refine the model. It makes sure the model is in line with the facts and specifications of the real world and is flexible enough to change with the times. Feedback loops also aid in spotting and fixing any problems like bias or overfitting that might not be obvious in the early phases of development.
